Hello! 

Welcome to my ecological simulation project! I made this December 2015 through February 2016. 
To use this program, open up command prompt or some equivilent. Go to the folder into which the file is. Make sure all supporting files are also there. Type "java -jar PJAS2015.jar". The program will then run without any further need for input. 
The program will output all data into the console as it is running. Once it is done, it'll output the data again as a table to copy-paste into a spreadsheet to analyze. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my programs I made while in high school for no direct benefit.
